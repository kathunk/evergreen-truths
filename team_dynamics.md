## Retros are the most important meeting

Every meeting is subject to cancelation, change, reconsideration. But not the weekly retro. It is sacred. 

The retro is where everyone in the company has the opportunity to say what's going well, what could be improved, and what changes we should make. This is the sources of all future changes to our processes. It clears the cache of procedural woes. 

## Feedback

Giving and receiving feedback is how we get good at our jobs. Feedback is a gift. Thus, we all give feedback to each other on a regular basis. 

It is also hard to do, and requires thought and practice. Plan ahead, and think through what you want to say. Every time you give feedback, have something positive and something constructive to say. Constructive doesn't mean negative. It can be along the lines of "You know how you could get even better? Try this hard thing."
