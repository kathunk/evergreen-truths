## Be ahead on tickets...

We need to have an ample number of good tickets ready for next sprint. Enough tickets that we have the privilege of selectivity. 

This is particularly helpful when someone gets stuck. They need to be able to go back to the hopper and pull a solid, clear ticket.

## But not TOO far ahead

Scoping out projects months (or, god forbid, years) in advance is a fools errand. We do not know the weather 6 months from now. Carefully scoping a detailed project that won't be worked on for 6 months is a dangerous game.
