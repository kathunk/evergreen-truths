We are professional problem solvers. We work on meaningful problems. We shape our work around problems we can solve. 

## Problem Statements

To ensure this, we write problem statements on everything: tickets, pull requests, scoping documents, meeting agendas.

## Don't Solve Non-Problems

We do not work on non-problems. Here are some examples of non-problems:

1. Gravity Problems: problems that have no solution, and thus are not problems. These are circumstances we must accept. 
2. Hypothetical Problems: problems for imaginary users or clients. 
3. Trivial Problems: problems that cause a small amount of pain for a small amount of people.
4. Problems that clearly go beyond the scope of our job.
